# Testing

## Step 1 smoke test (manual, Windows)
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run tauri dev` : a 1440x900 window titled "Dreamer" shows the italic wordmark on a pink background.
3. `npm run tauri build` : NSIS and MSI installers appear in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Step 2 checks
Automated (any OS): `npm run check:themes` prints contrast ratios for each built-in theme and exits non-zero if any text pair is below 4.5:1.

Manual (Windows, `npm run tauri dev`):
1. Window shows a slowly moving pearl-pink background, dotted white grid, frosted sidebar (left) and chat panel (right), five demo cards (one dashed "Claude suggests" ghost card with Keep/Dismiss), title pill with stage filter on top, zoom pill bottom-left, toolbar bottom-center.
2. Click each of the four theme swatches in the sidebar: the background colors fade over about half a second and all text/buttons re-tint. Relaunch: the chosen theme is still active with no flash of Pink.
3. Click stage filters (Cloud/Sketch/Draft/Pitch): matching demo cards hide and show.
4. Windows Settings > Accessibility > Visual effects > Animation effects off: the background becomes a still image (restart the app to be sure).
5. Minimize the window for a minute and restore: animation resumes without a time jump.
6. Resize to the minimum (1100x600): nothing overlaps.

## Not verified by the author
- Anything that runs on Windows beyond step 1 (the reduced-motion OS toggle, window minimize/restore, real GPU rendering, the global hotkey, tray, `tauri build`). On my side the UI type-checks and bundles, and screenshots were taken in headless Chrome with software WebGL (all 4 themes), not in the Tauri WebView2 window.
